Data Warehouse and BigQuery Notes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrHljAoD6nM&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=26

Data Warehouse - We will be using BigQuery mainly

Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) vs Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)

- OLAP databases are mainly used by analysts and for analytical purposes

OLTP
- Purpose
	- Control and run essential business operations in real time

- Data updates
	- Short, fast updates initiated by user

- Database design
	- Normalized databases for efficiency

- Space requirements
	- Generally small if historical data is archived

- Backup and recovery
	- Regular backups required to ensure business continuity and meet legal and governance requirements

- Productivity
	- Increases productivity of end users

- Data View
	- Lists day-to-day business transactions

- User Examples
	- Customer-facing personnel, clerks, online shoppers

OLAP
- Purpose
	- Plan, solve problems, support decisions, discover hidden insights

- Data updates
	- Data periodically refreshed with scheduled, long-running batch jobs

- Database design
	- Denormalized databases for analysis

- Space requirements
	- Generally large due to aggregating large datasets

- Backup and recovery
	- Lost data can be reloaded from OLTP database as needed in lieu of regular backups

- Productivity
	- Increases productivity of business managers, data analysts, and executives

- Data View
	- Multi-dimensional view of enterprise data

- User Examples
	- Knowledge workers such as data analysts, business analysts, and executives


What is a Data Warehouse?

- It is an OLAP solution
- Used for reporting and data analysis
- Generally consists of Meta Data, Summary Data, and Raw Data
- Data Warehouses can have many sources such as different operational systems, or other databases, or flat file systems
- Used by data analysts or data scientists

BigQuery

- this is a data warehouse solution by Google

- It is a serverless data warehouse
	- There are no servers to manage or database software to install
	- simple plug and play concept
	- When a company starts its journey in the data storage solution, a huge chunk of time and money is spent on creating, setting up, and maintaining of the servers
	

- Provides software as well as infrastructure
	- Has scalability and high-availability 
	- We can start with few gigabytes of data and scale to petabytes of data without any issues

- Built-in features like:
	- Machine Learning
	- Geospatial Analysis
	- Business Intelligence

- BigQuery maximizes flexibility by separating the compute engine that analyzes your data from your storage
	- So if needed we can upgrade the compute engine without having to touch our storage solution

- BigQuery generally caches the results


- Cost
	- On Demand Pricing
		- Based on the amount of data scanned or processed
		- 1 TB of data processed is $5

	- Flat Rate Pricing
		- Based on number of pre requested slots
		- 100 slots -> $2,000/month = 400 TB data processed on demand pricing
		- We also have to keep in mind about queries competing with each other

- BigQuery infers the data we are trying to import in; column names, their respective types, and if they are nullable or not

- When we use external data to create tables, bigQuery is not able to determine its row size or the table size
	- This is because the data itself is not inside bigQuery

- Partitions and Clustering

- Partitioning
	- Generally when we create a dataset, there are columns that are used the most
	- For example if we want using the date column alot and we partition the table on date column, it can improve the query performance by a lot
	- This is really good for bigQuery as now bigQuery will only process the data in that specific partition as opposed to processing all of the data

- Clustering
	- We can also cluster the tables according to a column (For example the "Tags" column in stackoverflow questions table)
	- example in the queries.sql file
	- The choice of using which column as for clustering is dependent on how we want to query our data
